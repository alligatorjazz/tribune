			<h1>DOWNLOAD!</h1>
			<p>So, uh, you can't download Tribune quite yet.</p>
			<p>It's still in a <i>very</i> early stage of development, and I want to put it through its paces before
				releasing the program (and its source!) to the public.</p>
			<p>However, if the guide has convinced you that Tribune is the tool for you, I (meaning me, <a
					href="https://ajazz.neocities.org">ajazz</a>) am definitely looking for beta testers -
				particularly those
				on Windows, because I don't have access to a Windows PC for development at the moment. If you want to
				try Tribune out before it's released to the public, shoot me an email at <a
